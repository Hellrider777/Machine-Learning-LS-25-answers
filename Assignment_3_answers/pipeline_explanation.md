# Machine Learning Pipeline Explanation

## Pipeline Overview and Components

This sentiment analysis pipeline leverages Hugging Face's transformers library to fine-tune BERT (bert-base-uncased) on the IMDb dataset for binary classification. The pipeline consists of five core components: dataset loading using Hugging Face's datasets library, preprocessing with BERT tokenization, model fine-tuning through the Trainer API, performance evaluation using accuracy and F1-score metrics, and model persistence for deployment.

## Design Rationale

The modular class-based architecture ensures code reusability and maintainability. I chose bert-base-uncased for its proven effectiveness in text classification tasks and widespread compatibility. The Trainer API provides optimized training with built-in features like automatic mixed precision and gradient accumulation. Dynamic padding through DataCollatorWithPadding improves computational efficiency by avoiding unnecessary padding tokens.

## Anticipated Challenges and Solutions

**Computational Requirements**: BERT fine-tuning demands significant GPU memory and processing power. I addressed this by implementing configurable batch sizes, using a subset of the dataset for faster prototyping, and providing clear hardware requirements documentation.

**Data Preprocessing**: Text sequences vary in length, requiring careful tokenization and padding strategies. The solution employs truncation at 512 tokens with dynamic padding during training, balancing memory efficiency with information preservation.

**Model Overfitting**: Limited dataset size could lead to overfitting. The pipeline implements early stopping based on F1-score and weight decay regularization to mitigate this risk.
